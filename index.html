            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my Skills Portfolio for my DCDA 40833 capstone course. This website will highlight work samples of my creative capabilities and passions, exploring the depths of my digital communication and growth in data analysis.
            <p>Each page represents various lab assignments completed throughout the semester. Additionally, I've included a section where I highlight some of my favorite marketing campaigns and creative ideas, with a focus on each strategic storytelling and audience experience.</p>
            <!-- I want this section to summarize the main "idea" of my website. I have plans to develop more depth about my "inspiration" sections, as I want to link my personal creative portfolio to my website I code, and a section devoted to a blog about campaigns I've discovered in the world and why I think they're meaningful.  -->

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>Who I am: </strong>Hi! My name is Abby Hanlon, and I'm a senior at TCU double-majoring in Strategic Communication and Data Analytics, graduating May 2026. I'm a people person, dedicated to creating meaningful relationships wherever I go, with a "can do" attitude.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests: </strong>I'm a creative communicator, passionate about digital branding, experiential marketing, and storytelling. I’ve gained hands-on experience through agency, nonprofit, and in-house roles, including graphic design, social media strategy, and event marketing positions. With a strong background in campaign execution, brand development, and content creation, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where imagination meets strategy.</p>
            <!-- This section is similar to my LinkedIn profile, to keep it professional, meaningful, and concise for potential employers. -->
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn: </strong>Throughout this portfolio and the work I accomplish in my final semester as an undergraduate student, I aspire to learn about advanced data visualization, specifically from a design perspective, along with strengthening my "niche" in storytelling and user experience.</p>
            <!-- I want this section to feel welcoming and warm, with some personalization behind my "about me" story.-->

            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> I've learned the importance of starting off strong with organization within code, and how you practice it. Keeping your VS Code space clean and easy to read is one of the most vital skills in learning how to develop a website.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> I’m having the most trouble being creative with my color schemes and beginning the initial stages of brainstorming what I want to make of this portfolio. I know that struggling with color schemes might seem kind of silly. Still, I’m passionate about a fair user experience and about creating a website that feels welcoming, engaging, and artistic.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
